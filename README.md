# Hangman

Welcome to [Hangman!](https://ydr-hangman-80c9bb83a43f.herokuapp.com/)

## Description

Hangman is a popular word guessing game. In this version, your goal is to guess the name of an animal. You only have a certain amount of attempts to guess the word correctly by suggesting letters one at a time. Each incorrect guess reduces your remaining attempts.

## How to Play

1. **Start Game**: The game begins automatically as soon as the program runs.

2. **Guess Letters**: Input a letter and try to guess the animal.

3. **End of Game**: Guess all the letters correctly before running out of attempts.<br>
Win or lose, after the game ends, you will be given the choice to play again.



<!-- ## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line. -->
